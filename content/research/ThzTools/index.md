[THzTools is an open source python package](https://dodge-research-group.github.io/thztools/) that we have developed for data analysis in time-domain spectroscopy. THz-TDS involves measurements of terahertz-frequency electromagnetic waveforms that are acquired as a function of time, which users typically represent as a function of frequency for analysis. THzTools makes it easier for researchers to use statistically optimal methods for doing this analysis, as described in [L. Mohtashemi et al., Opt. Express 29, 4912 (2021)](https://dodge-research-group.github.io/thztools/). Find more information and documentation [here](https://github.com/dodge-research-group/thztools/blob/main/README.md)
