Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is a data analysis technique used to analyze solid state systems. A typical measurement compares two waveforms, one of which has interacted with a material and another which has not.

In our lab, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to analyze condensed matter in order to observe the behaviour of solid state systems when excited by waveforms.
A typical measurement compares two waveforms, one of which has interacted with a material and another which has not.
In our lab we use two waveforms to investigate the electromagnetic responses of various matter over the terahertz frequency range. The pulses are measured as a time function, and signal processing techniques are required in order to relate the time function to the frequency function of the electromagnetic pulses. The ThzTools Python package has tools to help with the methods of THz-TDS analysis.
A paper discussing the usage of both THz-TDS and [THzTools is avaliable] below.
